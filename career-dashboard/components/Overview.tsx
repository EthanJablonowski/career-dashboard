          I&apos;ve been fortunate to build and scale digital products and brands across some of the most competitive and interesting industries out there, including fitness, healthcare, video games, ecommerce, and real estate.

          Over the last 13+ years, I&apos;ve watched the internet and the way people use it change dramatically. Along the way, I&apos;ve learned how businesses actually grow: by understanding who they&apos;re for, solving real problems, and creating brands people want to be part of.

          I work at the intersection of product development and growth marketing. I care about how things are made, how they reach the right people, and how they scale in the real world. I&apos;ve started businesses from scratch, helped grow others at scale, and have always been drawn to big challenges with real opportunity.

          My portfolio below is a collection of big swings, smaller experiments, and a relentless curiosity about how businesses actually work. That curiosity has consistently led me to interesting, high-impact opportunities, and I&apos;m excited to see where it leads next. I&apos;ll be based in Milwaukee starting April 2026. Feel free to reach out if you&apos;d like to connect.
