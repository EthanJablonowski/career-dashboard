          I&apos;ve been fortunate to build and scale digital products, services, and brands across some genuinely interesting (and challenging) markets—including fitness, healthcare, video games, ecommerce, and real estate.

          Over the last 13+ years, I&apos;ve watched the internet evolve how we work, shop, and connect with each other. Along the way, I&apos;ve learned how businesses actually grow: by understanding who your audience really is, building things they actually find valuable, and creating a brand story they identify with.

          I work at the intersection of product development and growth marketing. I care about how things are built, how they reach the right people, and how they scale in the real world. I&apos;ve started projects from scratch, scaled others, and I&apos;m consistently drawn to big challenges with real opportunity.

          The portfolio below is a collection of big swings and experiments—the product of a persistent curiosity about how businesses really work. That curiosity has led me to high-impact opportunities, and I&apos;m excited to see where it leads next.
