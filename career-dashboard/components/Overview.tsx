          My career has been a series of experiences that build on each other.
          I&apos;ve learned what it takes to build products people actually value, how to reach and help
          the people those products are for, and how to grow systems and brands that can serve more people over time.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          Along the way I&apos;ve worked in product, marketing, operations, and a lot of in-between—often at the same time.
