          I&apos;ve been fortunate to build and scale digital products, services, and brands across some genuinely interesting (and challenging) markets, including fitness, healthcare, video games, ecommerce, and real estate.

          Over the last 13+ years, I&apos;ve watched the internet evolve and shape all of us who use it as a part of our daily lives. Along the way, I&apos;ve learned how businesses actually grow: by understanding who they&apos;re for, building real value, and creating brands with stories people want to be part of.

          I work at the intersection of product development and growth marketing. I care about how things are built, how they reach the right people, and how they scale in the real world. I&apos;ve started projects from scratch, helped grow others at scale, and I&apos;m consistently drawn to big challenges with real opportunity.

          The portfolio below is a collection of big swings and experiments, and is the product of a persistent curiosity about how businesses really work. That curiosity has led me to high-impact opportunities, and I&apos;m excited to see where it leads next.
